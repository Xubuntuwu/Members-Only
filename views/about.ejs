        <br/>
        Members Only is an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. 
        <br/> <br/>
        To become a member, you must be assigned membership status by an admin after having created an account. Non-members with an account can still write and edit their own posts.

        The first 100 people who sign up are assigned membership privileges (that's basically everyone who will ever use this site lol).
